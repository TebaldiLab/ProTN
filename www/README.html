<p>ProTN is an integrative pipeline that analyze proteomics data
	obtained from MS. This pipeline take in input the raw files from <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/it/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/proteome-discoverer-software.html">Proteome
	Discoverer</a> (PD) or <a href="https://maxquant.org/">MaxQuant</a>
	(MQ). In the first phases it imputes and normalizes the data obtaining
	the matrix that is used in the enrichment analysis of the proteins. The
	enrichment perform a complete analysis in <a href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/">EnrichR</a> obtaining the
	results from all the DBs in it, and a PPI network analysis via <a href="https://string-db.org/">STRING</a>, During the enrichment steps,
	the only protein analyzed are the up- or down-regulated, discriminated
	by the following parameters.
