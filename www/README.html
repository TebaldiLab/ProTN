				<div id="normalization-of-the-intensities" class="section level3">
					<h3>02. Normalization and imputation of the intensities</h3>
					<p>The intensities are log2 transformed and normalized with DEqMS <span class="citation">(Zhu
							2022)</span>. Two methods are applied because a
						double normalization is required, one for peptides and one for proteins.
						At the peptide level, the normalization is done by the function
						equalMedianNormalization, which normalizes intensity distributions in
						samples so that they have median equal to 0.
					</p>
					<p>At the protein level, this operation is executed by the function
						medianSweeping. It applies the same median normalization used for
						peptides, but also it summarizes the peptide intensities into protein
						relative abundance by the median sweeping method.
					</p>
					<p>After the normalization the intensities from Mass Spectrometer need
						to be imputed. The principal method is based on the PhosR package <span class="citation">(Kim et
							al. 2021)</span> that performs a complex and
						well-balanced imputation of the data based on the conditions of the
						samples. As a backup method in case of problems with PhosR imputations,
						ProTN uses a Gaussian round imputation.
					</p>
					<p>In this step, two MDSs and two PCAs (proteins and peptides) are
						generated.

				</div>
				<div id="statistical-differential-analysis" class="section level3">
					<h3>03. Statistical differential analysis</h3>
					<p>The workflow continue with the differential analysis. This phase is
						applied to proteins and peptides, to obtain the significant proteins and
						peptides. Two slightly different methodologies are applyed since for
						proteins is used the DEqMS package <span class="citation">(Zhu
							2022)</span>, instead, for peptides is used the usual Limma package
						<span class="citation">(Ritchie et al. 2015)</span>. DEqMS is developed
						on top of Limma, but the method estimates different prior variances for
						proteins quantified by different numbers of PSMs/peptides per protein,
						therefore achieving better accuracy.
					</p>
					<p>Limma and DEqMS calculate DEPs for each comparison in the
						<em>design</em> file parameter. Each peptide or protein has different
						parameters: the log2 Fold Change, the P.Value, the adjusted P.Value and
						the log2 expression. In this pipeline, a protein/peptide is significant
						if passing 3 thresholds. A protein/peptide for each comparison can be
						Up-regulated or Down-regulated. It is Up-regulated if:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>the log2 FC is higher than the Fold Change threshold (FC &gt;
								Log2 FC thr),
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>the P.Value is lower than the threshold (P.Value &lt; P.Value
								thr),
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>the log2 expression is higher than the threshold (log2 expression
								&gt; Signal log2 expr thr).
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It is Down-regulated if:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>the log2 FC is lower of the Fold Change threshold (FC &lt; -Log2
								FC thr),
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>the P.Value is lower than the threshold (P.Value &lt; P.Value
								thr),
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>the log2 expression is higher than the threshold (log2 expression
								&gt; Signal log2 expr thr).
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In the output, for each comparison, this distinction is reported in
						the “<em>class</em>” column, which assumes value “+” if is up-regulated,
						“-” if down-regulated and “=” if it is not significant.
					</p>
					<p>Various figures are generated, first a bar plot that graphically
						represents the DEPs identified. Followed by comparison-specific volcano
						plots.

				<h2>ADDITIONAL STEPS:</h2>
				<div id="batch-effect-correction" class="section level3">
					<h3>B1. Batch Effect correction</h3>
					<p>If required by the experiment, a batch correction step can be applyed
						using <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/proBatch.html"
							style="font-size: 11pt;">proBatch</a> <span class="citation">(Cuklina et

				<div id="enrichment-analysis-of-the-differentially-expressed-proteins" class="section level3">
					<h3>E1. Enrichment analysis of the Differentially Expressed
						Proteins
					</h3>
					<div style="display: flex;">
						<p>The biological interpretation of the Differentially Expressed
							Proteins starts with the enrichment step. To execute this analysis,
							ProTN uses <a href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/">EnrichR</a> <span
								class="citation">(Jawaid 2022)</span>, a widely used tool that search on
							a large number of data sets to obtain information about many categories.
							EnrichR organises its hundreds of data sets in 8 sections:
							Transcription, Pathways, Ontologies, Diseases/Drugs, Cell Types, Misc,
							Legacy, and Crowd.
						</p>

						<p><a href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/"><img src="images/enrichr_logo.png" width="200px"
									alt="" /></a></p>
					</div>
					<p>Since the analysis that a user wants to perform can be different,
						each comparison has 3 sets of proteins: the Up-regulated (called Up),
						the Down-regulated (called Down), and the set (called all) obtained by
						the merge of Up- and Down-regulated proteins. EnrichR provides for each
						term much information. It returns the statistical parameters, like
						P.Value, fdr, odds ratio and combined score. At the same time, it gives
						the overlap size, the number of genes in the term and the genes of the
						input list find in the term.
					</p>
					<p>The tons of data downloaded from EnrichR are exported in two
						modalities. The tool creates an <em>RData</em> of the complete data
						frame, in this way the user can easily import in R to perform further
						analysis and plots. But also, it generates an <em>Excel</em> file with
						only the significant terms. The process uses the filters define in the
						options file to differentiate the relevant terms from the globality.
					</p>
					<p>A term to be significative need to have:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>a P.Value lower of P.Value thr for enrichment (P.Value &lt;
								P.Value thr for enrichment),
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an Overlap Size higher than Overlap size thr for enrichment
								(Overlap Size &gt; Overlap size thr for enrichment).
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Besides that, the pipeline plots the enrichment results in different
						figures. The 4 plots can be split into 2 categories. The first two are
						filtered on the data-sets, they illustrate only the data-sets written in
						the column DB to analyse of the options file. The other 2 are filtered
						on words to search on the term description, it uses the list of words in
						column Terms to search.
					</p>
					<img src="images/figures/enrichment.png" width="50%"
						style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" />
					<h4>E1.1. Enrichment analysis of the whole set of proteins discovered by the experiment</h4>
					<p>In same cases can be usefull have the enrichment of the whole proteome discovered by the
						experiment.
						For example it can be used as negative control of the differentially expressed proteins. So,
						the entire proteome is analysed with EnrichR, and saved in an RData and in an Excel file.
						Also, as before, 4 plots can be generated, in this case adding as last dot column the
						negative control provided by the whole proteome.</p>

					<h3>N1. Protein-Protein Interaction network analysis of Differentially
						Expressed Proteins
					</h3>
					<div style="display: flex;">
						<p>Last analitical step is the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network
							analysis, since PPIs are essential in almost all processes of the cell,
							and it is crucial for understanding cell physiology in different states.
							For each comparison, ProTN analyses the interaction between the DEPs
							using <a href="https://string-db.org/">STRING</a> <span class="citation">(Szklarczyk et al.
								2021)</span>.
						</p>
						<p><a href="https://string-db.org/"><img src="images/string_logo_2015.png" width="200"

					</div>
					<p>The species-specific database is retrieved from STRING server, an
						accurate analysis discover all the interactions and an iGraph <span class="citation">(Csardi and
							Nepusz 2006)</span> network is generated.
						Later, the proteins are clustered via iGraph function which identify
						dense subgraph by optimizing modularity score.
					</p>
					<p>Since the network can vary a lot on composition, two ggplot layout
						are used: Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm and the Kamada-Kawai
						algorithm.
